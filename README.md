## Announcement
- **Issues** are closed for now as I focus on real-life and other ventures. I am happy with the position of BetterCooldownManager. Development will continue but at a slower rate.

- API for AddOns to add their own anchors to Utility, Buffs, Custom, Item & Trinket Bars.

## Libraries
- [Ace3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ace3): Database & Configuration Windows are all handled by Ace3 & Ace3 GUI.
- [LibDeflate](https://github.com/SafeteeWoW/LibDeflate.git): Handles importing/exporting of profiles.
- [LibDualSpec](https://github.com/AdiAddons/LibDualSpec-1.0.git): Handles specialization profiles.
- [LibSharedMedia](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libsharedmedia-3-0): Handles all additional media for the AddOn.
- [LibEditModeOverride](https://github.com/plusmouse/LibEditModeOverride): Helps manage EditMode securely.

All of these libraries contribute to the success of BetterCooldownManager & are highly appreciated by myself.

## About the Project
This is a passion project & this has to be maintained as much as possible in order for the longevity of the AddOn. It is solo-developed, but some very kind people from the community have already started contributing.

## Future Plans
In the future, skinning the Buff Bars will be available. The code & GUI are all present already but final improvements are still to be made. Along with this, Custom Glows will be added when I find time to implement them appropriately.
